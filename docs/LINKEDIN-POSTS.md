## Post 1 — Launch / who we are

We just launched FreeDon AI.

The problem: a lot of language learners get good at reading and listening — then freeze when it's time to actually speak.

We're building an AI tutor that's built for conversation. Real back-and-forth. Your level. Your schedule.

No fluff. Just practice that helps you open your mouth and speak.

If that's you, we'd love to have you on the waitlist.

## Post 2 — Why speaking matters (educational)

Reading and listening are only half the battle.

The skill that actually changes how you use a language is **speaking** — and most apps don't give you enough of it.

At FreeDon AI we're focused on one thing: giving you real conversation practice with an AI tutor. So you can build confidence and fluency, not just recognition.

Early access is open. Link in comments. 👇

## Post 3 — Building in public

Building in public: FreeDon AI 🗣️

We're creating an AI tutor that focuses on **speaking** — real conversations, not just taps and multiple choice.

If you're learning a language and want more speaking practice, we'd love your feedback.

## Post 4 — Tip (shareable)

One thing that helped me get over the "I understand but can't speak" block:

Talk out loud to yourself in the language — even for 2 minutes a day.

No app, no partner. Just you forming sentences. It feels weird until it doesn't.

We're building FreeDon AI so you can do that with an AI tutor: real conversation, your pace. Waitlist in comments.

## Post 5 — Problem → solution

You've been there: you can read the menu, follow the podcast — but when someone asks you a question, you blank.

It's not you. It's that most practice is passive (reading, listening, tapping). Speaking needs **speaking**.

FreeDon AI is an AI tutor built for that: real back-and-forth, so you practice the skill that actually matters.

## Post 6 — Ask for feedback

Quick ask for anyone learning a language:

What's the one thing that would make you actually *speak* more — not just study more?

We're building FreeDon AI around that (real conversation with an AI tutor) and would love your input. Drop a comment or join the waitlist: freedonai.tech

## Post 7 — Personal / why we're building this

I kept getting good at understanding a language — and still freezing when I had to speak.

So we're building the thing I wished existed: an AI tutor that's built for **conversation**. Not drills. Not multiple choice. Real back-and-forth.

FreeDon AI. Early access is open: freedonai.tech

If you've ever felt stuck at "I understand but can't say it," you're who we're building for.

## Post 8 — Short milestone / update

Update: FreeDon AI waitlist is live 🗣️

## Post 9 — “Most people get this wrong”

Most language learners focus on vocabulary and grammar.

Nothing wrong with that — but the skill that actually gets you to *use* the language is **speaking**. And most tools don't give you enough of it.

We're building FreeDon AI to fix that: conversation-first practice with an AI tutor.

## Tips when posting

- **Link:** Put freedonai.tech in the post or in the first comment (some say link in comment gets slightly better reach).
- **When:** Tuesday–Thursday morning often works well; test what works for your audience.
- **Engagement:** Reply to every comment in the first hour to boost visibility.
- **Mix:** Rotate launch posts, tips, problem/solution, and “ask for feedback” so it doesn’t feel repetitive.
