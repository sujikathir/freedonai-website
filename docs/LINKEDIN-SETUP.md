FreeDon AI is building an AI language tutor focused on one thing: **speaking**.

Most learners get good at reading and listening but still freeze when it’s time to talk. We’re here to close that gap. FreeDon lets you practice real conversations with an AI tutor — so you can build confidence and fluency in the language you’re learning.

✓ Conversation-first, not just drills  
✓ Adapts to your level and goals  
✓ Practice when you want, without scheduling  
✓ Built for the skill that matters most: speaking  

We’re early stage and building in public. If you’re a language learner who wants more speaking practice, we’d love to hear from you.

**Suggested copy (edit to your voice):**

We just launched FreeDon AI.

The problem: a lot of language learners get good at reading and listening — then freeze when it’s time to actually speak.

We’re building an AI tutor that’s built for conversation. Real back-and-forth. Your level. Your schedule.

No fluff. Just practice that helps you open your mouth and speak.

If that’s you, we’d love to have you on the waitlist.

### Post 2 — Why speaking (educational)

**Suggested copy:**

Reading and listening are only half the battle.

The skill that actually changes how you use a language is **speaking** — and most apps don’t give you enough of it.

At FreeDon AI we’re focused on one thing: giving you real conversation practice with an AI tutor. So you can build confidence and fluency, not just recognition.

Early access is open. Link in comments. 👇
