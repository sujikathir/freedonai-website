# Prompt: Build the FreeDon AI Website

Use this prompt when asking an AI or developer to build the website for freedonai.tech.

---

**Task:** Build a marketing/landing website for **FreeDon AI** (freedonai.tech), a company that makes an **AI language tutor app focused on speaking**.

**Context:**
- Many language apps focus on reading and listening (vocabulary, multiple choice, passive practice). FreeDon AI is built around **speaking**: real conversation with an AI tutor, so users get the practice they need to actually speak the language, not just recognize it.
- The site should **not** name or compare to any specific competitor (e.g., no “better than X” or “unlike X”). Position the product on its own merits: AI-powered speaking practice, conversation-first learning, and efficiency for real-world use.

**Goals:**
1. **Attract** visitors (clear value proposition above the fold).
2. **Convince** them that speaking practice with AI is the missing piece in language learning.
3. **Convert** them to try the app (strong CTAs: waitlist, beta signup, or “Get early access”).

**Requirements:**
- **Tone:** Professional, aspirational, and encouraging. Modern tech/product vibe, not corporate or academic.
- **Audience:** Language learners who feel stuck at “understanding but not speaking,” or who want more speaking practice than they get elsewhere.
- **Content:** Emphasize (1) **speaking** as the core skill, (2) **AI tutor** that adapts to the user, (3) **conversation** instead of drills, (4) **efficiency**—practice when you want, at your level.
- **Design:** High-quality, distinctive, and trustworthy. Avoid generic “AI slop” aesthetics Use a cohesive color palette (see SPECS), clear typography, and sections that scroll well. **Animations:** Include playful, smooth animations (scroll reveals, hover bounces, subtle motion) inspired by modern learning apps—cute and funny but unique to FreeDon (no copying). Use Framer Motion or similar for React/Next.js.
- **Technical:** Next.js (App Router) preferred for easy future edits and Vercel/Lovable compatibility. TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Fast, responsive, mobile-first. No backend for v1—CTAs link to a form or mailto.
- **Brand:** Domain is freedonai.tech. Company name: **FreeDon AI**. Tagline and microcopy should reflect “freedom to speak” and “AI tutor for real conversation.”

**Deliverables:**
- A complete, deployable website (HTML/CSS/JS or a simple framework like Next.js/Astro if preferred).
- Copy written for the site (hero headline, subheadline, section titles, short body text, button labels).
- Clear placement for one primary CTA (e.g., “Join the waitlist” or “Get early access”) repeated in hero and before footer.
- README with instructions to run locally and deploy (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting).

**Out of scope for this task:** Actual app logic, auth, or backend; only the marketing website for freedonai.tech.
